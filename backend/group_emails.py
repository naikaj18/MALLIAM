def group_emails_by_llm(emails):

    Takes a list of emails, each with 'subject', 'sender', 'summary', 'time', and 'suggested_reply',
    and returns a single string that groups similar emails together in a human-readable format.
    
    Expected format for each email item:
    {
      "subject": "Subject of Email",
      "sender": "sender@example.com",
      "summary": "A concise summary",
      "time": "2025-04-01 10:30 AM",
      "suggested_reply": "A short suggested reply or empty string"
    }
    
    The output should have a heading for each group (e.g., based on topic or relevance) with symbols, and then list the emails in numbered order using the following format:
    
    **Heading for Group (with an emoji)**
    
    1. **Subject:** [subject]
       **Sender:** [sender]
       **Time:** [time]
       **Summary:** [summary]
       **Suggested Reply:** [suggested_reply]
    
    Ensure extra blank lines between emails for readability, and do not include any introductory commentary.
    Return only the final grouped summary text as Markdown.
