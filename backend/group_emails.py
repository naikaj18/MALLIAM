def group_emails_by_llm(emails):

    Takes a list of emails, each with 'subject', 'sender', 'summary', 'time', and 'suggested_reply',
    and returns a single string that groups similar emails together in a human-readable Markdown format.
    
    Expected format for each email item:
    {
      "subject": "Subject of Email",
      "sender": "sender@example.com",
      "summary": "A concise summary",
      "time": "2025-04-01 10:30:00",
      "suggested_reply": "A short suggested reply or empty string"
    }
    
    The output will have a heading for each group that includes an appropriate emoji and a descriptive category name
    (e.g., "ðŸ“¦ Job Applications & Opportunities"). Then, for each email in that group, list the details in numbered order using:
    
    1. **Subject:** [subject]  
       **Sender:** [sender]  
       **Time:** [time]  
       **Summary:** [summary]  
       **Suggested Reply:** ðŸ’¬ [suggested_reply]
       
    Ensure there is an extra blank line between each email for readability.
    Return only the final grouped summary text as plain Markdown with no introductory commentary.
