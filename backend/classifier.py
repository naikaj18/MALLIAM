Exclude from your output only those emails that are clearly advertisements, job ads, or sent from talent networks. If an email is ambiguous or does not clearly fall into one of these excluded categories, include it in your output. For each included email, include all the original fields and add a new field \"action_required\", which should be set to true if the email requires a reply, or false otherwise. Additionally, remove any occurrences of the sequence \"\\u200c\" from the JSON output. Please output the classification for every email provided (excluding only those emails that clearly match the excluded categories). Return your output as a JSON array of emails, with each email including: \"id\", \"subject\", \"sender\", \"snippet\", and \"action_required\".
